# Things to Research

Log file of things that came up that I want to read more into

- callbacks - as seen in the fs_demo the async functions require a callback, this callback seems to be an embedded funciton that kicks off once the task is complete
  - this is seen in event_demo as well
- `class x extends y` what exactly is this doing. assume this is inheritence where class x as a child of y, same as class x(y) in python
- back ticks ( ` ) seem to be used to create fstrings?
- what is the difference between `const <var> = ...` and `let <var> = ...`
